# Temporal_Prediction
This repository focuses on leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal modeling of pollution data from air quality monitoring stations in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. The primary goal is to address the limitations of hourly pollution data by generating denser temporal pollution maps, enabling better understanding and prediction of individual exposure to pollutants.

The repository contains:

Data: Includes datasets acquired from monitoring stations in Bangalore, Karnataka, India. These datasets provide hourly pollution data, which serve as the basis for the predictive modeling tasks.

Models: Implementation of LSTM networks for temporal modeling of pollution data. This includes basic LSTM models as well as LSTM models with an attention layer. The attention mechanism enhances the model's ability to capture relevant temporal patterns, leading to improved predictive performance.

Evaluation: Evaluation scripts to assess the performance of the LSTM models. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and others are calculated to quantify the accuracy of the predictions.

By utilizing this repository, users can gain insights into the temporal dynamics of pollution in Bangalore and explore the potential of LSTM networks for generating denser pollution maps. Furthermore, it serves as a platform for further research and development in the field of air quality monitoring and prediction. Contributions and feedback are welcome to enhance the repository's capabilities and improve its utility for the broader community.
